        "Images like that tell us how our brain does it's best to interpret two conflicting features based on what we know in our realities. You Have seen many optical illusions that work along this principle. Ultimately your brain is doing the best it can to sort the visual information given based on real world interactions. But images are not limited by these things and can be distorted to create images that challenge these fundumenatal things we have instinctually applied in our lives. \n",

So in contrast the colored image is seen as 3 dimensional. classic rgb layers and what not\n",
